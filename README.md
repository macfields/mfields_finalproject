# Harvard Volleyball 2018 Analytics

DataVolley is a statistics and analysis software used by most collegiate volleyball teams. More information on DataVolley can be found at https://www.dataproject.com/Products/EN/en/Volleyball/DataVolley4. DataVolley files from each match can be downloaded in the .dvw format. There is a package in R, "datavolley", that allows for the analysis of these files in R. It was created by Ben Raymond, and the github for this package can be found at https://github.com/raymondben/datavolley. I analyzed 21 datavolley files from the Harvard Women's Volleyball 2018 Season. The data was given to me by Jared Goldberg, Assistant Coach of the Harvard Women's Volleyball team. 

I analyzed setting, serving, receiving, digging, and attacking results and created plots that show the setting tendencies and serving trajectories of Harvard Volleyball and its opponents. As expected, Harvard and its opponents are much more likely to set their middles on a perfect or good pass than a poor pass. Second, on poor passes, Harvard sets a vast majority of the balls to the outside hitter, but if the pass if ok, the distribution is split between the outside and rightside. Lastly, serves that resulted in an ace did not tend to go towards the middle of the court, but instead deep or towards the sidelines.
