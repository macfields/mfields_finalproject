# Harvard Volleyball 2018 Analytics


I analyzed attacking, receiving, and digging efficiencies from the Harvard Women’s Volleyball Team’s 14 Ivy League matches this season. 

For both receiving and digging, I created density plots that show the ideal location of a pass based on the resulting hitting percentage for all sets that occur at a specific location. 

Heatmaps also show hitting percentages for each start zone. These plots can be filtered by factors such as the attack combination ran and the number of blockers up.
